The **Digital Circuit Design** project is a software tool designed to simulate the creation and testing of basic digital circuits. It allows users to build circuits using various logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT, along with input sources and output lamps. The program provides an interactive environment where users can connect these components with wires, simulating how they would function in a real-world digital circuit.

One of the primary objectives of this project was to refactor the existing basic version of the program by incorporating object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism. This refactoring made it easier to add new components and extend the functionality of the software. Additionally, the project includes advanced features such as evaluating circuit outputs and the ability to group multiple gates into compound circuits, allowing users to design more complex systems.

## Features
